## 📝 Content Guidelines

### Documentation Standards

- **Accuracy**: At least some examples must be tested and working
- **Clarity**: Write for developers of all skill levels
- **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns and formatting
- **Completeness**: Include all necessary context and explanations

### Code Examples

When adding or updating code examples:

- **Multi-language Support**: Include examples in all 8 supported languages:

  <CodeTabs
    examples={{
      curl: `curl -X GET "https://panel.example.com/api/client" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"`,
      javascript: `const response = await fetch('https://panel.example.com/api/client', {
        headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' }
      });`,
      // ... other languages
    }}
