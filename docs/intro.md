## Usage of AI

This documentation was partly written by AI. It has been done in such a way where it is safe and robust. This includes a testing framework against a live environment. On each update of the documentation, most API calls are tested against a live, updated Pterodactyl environment. This is done in Github Actions which is publicly accessible by everyone.

## API Overview

The Pterodactyl API consists of two main components:

### Client API
The **Client API** allows users to perform actions on their own servers, such as:
- Managing server power states

### Application API  
The **Application API** is designed for administrative tasks and integration with external systems, allowing:
- Server creation and management
