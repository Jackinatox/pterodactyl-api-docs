# Client API

The **Client API** allows users to perform actions on servers they have access to. This includes server management, file operations, database management, and more.

## Base URL
```
https://your-panel.com/api/client
```

## Authentication
All Client API requests require a Client API key passed in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl "https://your-panel.com/api/client" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ptlc_YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: Application/vnd.pterodactyl.v1+json"
```
