# Application API

The **Application API** provides administrative access to manage the entire Pterodactyl Panel. These endpoints require administrative privileges and are designed for panel automation, integration with external systems, and comprehensive server management.

## Base URL
```
https://your-panel.com/api/application
```

## Authentication
All Application API requests require an Application API key with administrative privileges:

```bash
curl "https://your-panel.com/api/application/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ptla_YOUR_APPLICATION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: Application/vnd.pterodactyl.v1+json"
```

:::warning Administrative Access Required
These endpoints require administrative privileges and should only be used by trusted applications with proper authentication. Application API keys provide full panel access.

## Common Features

### Filtering and Pagination
Most list endpoints support advanced filtering and pagination:

```bash
# Filter users by email domain
GET /api/application/users?filter[email]=@example.com

# Paginate results
GET /api/application/servers?page=2&per_page=25

# Sort by creation date
GET /api/application/nodes?sort=-created_at
```

### Relationship Inclusion
Include related data in responses:

```bash
# Include servers with user data
GET /api/application/users/1?include=servers

# Include allocations and location with node
GET /api/application/nodes/1?include=allocations,location
```

### Response Format
All responses follow consistent formatting:

```json
{
  "object": "list|resource_type",
  "data": [ /* resource data */ ],
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total": 50,
      "count": 25,
      "per_page": 25,
      "current_page": 1,
      "total_pages": 2,
      "links": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The Application API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- **Default Limit**: 240 requests per minute per API key
- **Burst Limit**: Up to 10 requests per second
- **Headers**: Response includes rate limit headers

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 240
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 235
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1642686400
```

## Getting Started

1. **Generate an Application API Key**
   - Log in as an administrator
   - Go to `https://your-panel.com/admin/api`
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Optionally restrict by IP addresses

2. **Make Your First Request**
   ```bash
   curl "https://your-panel.com/api/application/users" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ptla_YOUR_APPLICATION_API_KEY" \
     -H "Accept: Application/vnd.pterodactyl.v1+json"
   ```

3. **Explore Available Resources**
   - Start with user management to test your API key
   - Use server management for automated deployments
   - Configure nodes and locations for infrastructure management

## Source Code References

All Application API endpoints are implemented in the Pterodactyl Panel source code:

- **Controllers**: [`app/Http/Controllers/Api/Application/`](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/tree/1.0-develop/app/Http/Controllers/Api/Application)
- **Routes**: [`routes/api-application.php`](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/blob/1.0-develop/routes/api-application.php)
- **Services**: [`app/Services/`](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/tree/1.0-develop/app/Services)
- **Models**: [`app/Models/`](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/tree/1.0-develop/app/Models)

For detailed source code references, see our [Source References Guide](/docs/source-references).

## Security Considerations

- **Never expose Application API keys** in client-side code
- **Use IP restrictions** when possible for additional security
- **Regularly rotate API keys** for production environments
- **Monitor API usage** through the panel's audit logs
- **Implement proper error handling** to avoid exposing sensitive information

## Next Steps

- Start with [User Management](/docs/api/application/users) for basic administrative operations
- Explore [Server Management](/docs/api/application/servers) for automated deployments
- Configure [Node Management](/docs/api/application/nodes) for infrastructure scaling
- Review [Authentication](/docs/authentication) for security best practices
